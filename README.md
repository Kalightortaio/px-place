## PX Place
This is a cellular automata designed as a falling sand simulator. At the same time, this is also configured as a community driven social project or experiment. Inspired from the line of early web particle simulators such as the Powder Game by Dan-Ball, and the sheer creativity behind Reddit's r/place, this web app aims to meld the two concepts into one experience.

Frameworks used: React.js, Next.js, Socket.io
